# QIO
Next-generation quantum language model (QLM) architecture. Ideation stage, long-term project.  
Our ultimate goal is to replace classical superintelligence with quantum-powered ultraintelligence.  
We call this Artificial Ultraintelligence (AUI).

"QIO" is a trademark of the [Quantum Intelligence Society](https://quantumintelligencesociety.org), a DC-based nonprofit dedicated to the merging of quantum and artificial intelligence.

If we can truly achieve our goal, this repository will likely become the number one repository on all of Github.  
However, we will break our development into stages, starting with hybrid QLMs and working are way forward as AI models running natively on quantum becomes increasingly feasible.
