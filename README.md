# Q-I/O
QIO™ is a next-generation quantum language model (QLM) architecture.

Our ultimate goal is to replace classical superintelligence with quantum-powered ultraintelligence.  
We call this Artificial Ultraintelligence (AUI).

QIO, pronounced "key-o", stands for Quantum Input/Output.
QIO is a trademark of the [Quantum Intelligence Society (QIS)](https://quantumintelligencesociety.org), a DC-based nonprofit dedicated to the merging of quantum and artificial intelligence.

If we can truly achieve our goal, this repository will likely become the number one repository on all of Github, and the most powerful AI model in the world.  
With that said, we will break our development into stages, starting with hybrid QLMs and working are way forward as AI models running natively on quantum becomes increasingly feasible.

- **Phase 1**: Hybrid QLMs — classical inference with quantum-inspired modules
- **Phase 2**: Quantum-enhanced language models — leveraging near-term quantum devices (NISQ era)
- **Phase 3**: Fully quantum-native AI architectures — built for fault-tolerant quantum hardware
- **Phase 4**: Artificial Ultraintelligence (AUI) — the asymptotic limit of cognitive capability

We are currently in phase 1/4.
Getting from phase 1 to phase 4 may be achieved before 2030 (5 years from this project's inception), but we are confident that we may be the world's first to achieve true AUI.
