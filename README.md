# QIO
Next-generation quantum language model (QLM) architecture. Ideation stage, long-term project.  
Our ultimate goal is to replace classical superintelligence with quantum-powered ultraintelligence.  
We call this Artificial Ultraintelligence (AUI).

QIO™ (pronounced "key-o") is a trademark of the [Quantum Intelligence Society](https://quantumintelligencesociety.org), a DC-based nonprofit dedicated to the merging of quantum and artificial intelligence.

If we can truly achieve our goal, this repository will likely become the number one repository on all of Github, and the most powerful AI model in the world.  
With that said, we will break our development into stages, starting with hybrid QLMs and working are way forward as AI models running natively on quantum becomes increasingly feasible.

- Phase 1: Hybrid QLMs — classical inference with quantum-inspired modules
- Phase 2: Quantum-enhanced language models — leveraging near-term quantum devices (NISQ era)
- Phase 3: Fully quantum-native AI architectures — built for fault-tolerant quantum hardware
- Phase ∞: Artificial Ultraintelligence (AUI) — the asymptotic limit of cognitive capability
